Introduction
------------

A simple Python/Cython example package. It contains the following Cython examples:

* Small anonymisation utility that's written in C++, which in 
turn is wrapper around the OpenSSL EVP library.
* Using/extending and extending Cython types.



Usage
-----

Clone the project and run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

It should automatically compile and install the example in edit mode.

**NB:** I recommend creating and using a virtualenv ;)

Run main.py
```bash
python main.py
```

A bunch of stuff will be printed.
